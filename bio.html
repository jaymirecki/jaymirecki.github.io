            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Born in the first days of 1998, Jay Mirecki was a wonderful 
                child. He was loved by his family, despite the expressions on 
                his sister's faces in early family photos. Jay's life, 
                however, has not been without challenges. With his family's 
                support, Jay beat pediatric cancer and survived a fractured 
                skull. Since then, Jay graduated from East Lyme High School
                and his currently a junior at Tufts University studying 
                Computer Science and Biology.

                Jay's goal in life is to see a cure to cancer. In the words 
                of one of his oncologists, "someone will find a cure, why not 
                you?" As his studies in biology continued, Jay realized that
                there will likely never be one magic bullet to "cure" cancer.
                The only path to an all purpose solution may be a viral 
                delivery system for a patient's own DNA to replace mutated DNA
                in cancer cells.
            </p><p>
                Early in his college career, Jay realized that his best tool 
                in the fight to help pediatric cancer patients may not be a 
                degree in biology, but rather a degree in computer science. 
                Currently enrolled in a machine learning course and looking 
                forward to computational biology in the autumn of 2019, Jay
                hopes to use the power of computers to help researchers and 
                clinicians deliver the final blow to cancer.
