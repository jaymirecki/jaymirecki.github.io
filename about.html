            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Let's start with obvious question: What <em>is</em> my name? Is it Jay Mirecki? Is it Jarett Mirecki? Is it just J? It's not a silly thing to ask. It's been asked before and it'll be asked again.</p>
            <p>I was born Jarett M. Mirecki. Since that day, my friends and family have called me Jay (unless I'm in trouble, in which case Jarett is the only acceptable form of address). On all official forms, my name is Jarett. Teachers, professors, and employers have all called me by either of the two names, and I respond to both. If you don't annunciate well, I'll even respond to Jake. The point is, call me what you like, I'll likely respond either way.</p>
            <p>So what do I do? I'm in my junior year at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_University">Tufts University</a> as a double major in biology and computer science. When I first enrolled, I declared a major in biology but, after taking my first computer science course, decided to declare a second major. My current interest in the fields is using computer models with health data to improve prediction of clinical outcomes.</p>
            <p>"How did you get started down this path?" is a question you might ask. Well, I started programming in high school, even though I didn't realize that was what I was doing. As a big fan of Star Wars (both the old and new canons) and video games, I naturally became interested in modding Star Wars Battlefront II (2005). Using primarily LUA, I enjoyed creating new levels and gameplay to fit my personal style. During my freshman year of college, my older sister insisted that I take a computer science course and, eager to expand my horizons beyond the bioloy lab, I took the intro course and never looked back.</p>
            <p>While pursuing my academic track with computer science, I have continued to make mods for games on the side (now primarily for GTA:V in C#) as well as smaller personal projects to explore different languages. I've also had the opportunity to be on the course staff for a couple classes, and relished the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the subjects and help students facing the same challenges I did. Currently the class that most captures my interest is my machine learning class where I've gotten to work with clinical data to build models that predict medical outcomes.</p>
            <p>When I'm not in class or coding for fun, I do have other hobbies. At Tufts I've been involved with the <a href='https://tuftsquidditch.weebly.com/'>quidditch team</a> both as a player and manager. I also enjoy running and biking. Throughout high school I played soccer and ran indoor and outdoor track. In the summer following my freshman year of high school, I created a <a href='https://www.crowdrise.com/ride-for-rising-sun/fundraiser/jaymirecki?fbclid=IwAR3CP0FdgIj3RxJwp0RzDbvdq35YNNG0TtfuVH0MeIpCnlVH5ULYOBUvFVY'>100 mile bike ride</a> to raise money for <a href='http://www.camprisingsun.com/'>Camp Rising Sun</a>. Camp Rising Sun is a camp for kids who have faced a diagnosis of cancer where I volunteer as a counselor.</p>
