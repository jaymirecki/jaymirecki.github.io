            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Let's start with obvious question: What <em>is</em> my name? Is it Jay Mirecki? Is it Jarett Mirecki? Is it just J? It's not a silly thing to ask. It's been asked before and it'll be asked again.</p>
            <p>I was born Jarett M. Mirecki. Since that day, my friends and family have called me Jay (unless I'm in trouble, in which case Jarett is the only acceptable form of address). On all official forms, my name is Jarett. Teachers, professors, and employers have all called me by either of the two names, and I respond to both. If you don't annunciate well, I'll even respond to Jake. The point is, call me what you like, I'll likely respond either way.</p>
            <p>So what do I do? I'm in my junior year at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_University">Tufts University</a> as a double major in biology and computer science. When I first enrolled, I declared a major in biology but, after taking my first computer science course, decided to declare a second major.</p>
